# Canvas experiment

Use the input to provide a url, the program will try to find de site favicon.ico and add it to the canvas. The icon will be animated on the canvas.

## Key learings
 * Get the context first, everything happens there.
 * Canvas need to be cleared at every animation frame.
 * Canvas it all about context, it need to be configured before every new paint.

## What's next
 * Collision detection.
 * A better way to add icons without writing the urls.
